// muable/immuable
// If an item is mutable, modifying the copy also modifies the original. 
// If itâ€™s immutable, modifying the copy does not affect the original.

// A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.
// Immutables are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.
